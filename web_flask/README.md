Airbnb Clone Web Framework with Flask

What is a Web Framework?
A web framework is a software framework designed to aid the development of web applications, including web services, web resources, and web APIs. It provides a structured and organized way to build, deploy, and scale web applications by offering pre-built components, tools, and utilities.

How to Build a Web Framework with Flask
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is lightweight and designed to be easy to use and extend. Here's a guide on how to build a web framework using Flask:

Installation:

Install Flask using pip:

pip install Flask
Hello World with Flask:

Let's create a file, e.g., app.py.

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Run the application:

python app.py
Defining Routes in Flask:

Routes define the URL patterns that our application will respond to.
Use the @app.route() decorator to associate a function with a specific URL.
Handling Variables in a Route:

We can capture variables from the URL by defining them in the route:

@app.route('/user/<username>')
def show_user_profile(username):
    return 'User %s' % username
What is a Template:

Templates are files that contain dynamic content and are used to generate HTML responses.
Flask uses Jinja2 as its template engine.
Creating an HTML Response in Flask Using a Template:

Let's create a templates folder in our project.
Create an HTML file, e.g., index.html:
html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Flask Web App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
</body>
</html>
Update your Flask app:

from flask import render_template

@app.route('/greet/<name>')
def greet(name):
    return render_template('index.html', name=name)
Creating a Dynamic Template (Loops, Conditions, etc.):

Use Jinja2 features in your templates for dynamic content:
html
{% for item in items %}
    <li>{{ item }}</li>
{% endfor %}
Displaying Data from a MySQL Database in HTML:

Install Flask-MySQL extension:

pip install Flask-MySQL
Use Flask-MySQL to connect to your MySQL database.
Query data from the database and pass it to the template.
